# Tennis Shots Recognition through Human-Pose Estimation and Deep LSTM-based Neural Network

## 📌 Project Description
This project implements a deep learning model designed to classify typical tennis strokes from RGB video inputs. The system utilizes **OpenPose** for human pose estimation to extract skeletal features from the **THETIS dataset**. These features are processed by a **Deep Bidirectional LSTM Neural Network** with an **Attention Layer** to recognize specific actions across 10 distinct classes of tennis shots.

## 📂 Implementation & Results
* **Implementation:** Please refer to the **Jupyter Notebook** for the source code, data preprocessing, and training routines.
* **Results:** Please see the **Slide Presentation** for detailed performance metrics, confusion matrices, and architectural diagrams.
